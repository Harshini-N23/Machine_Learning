  ## 1. Supervised Learning
  Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning it learns from input-output pairs. It's used for tasks like regression and classification.

### **Simple Linear Regression**

This program explores the foundational concept of linear regression, a supervised learning technique used for predicting numerical values based on input features. It demonstrates how to fit a straight line to data points to make predictions. The program also demonstrates how outliers can be influence the output of a regression model.

### **Logistic Regression**
Dive into logistic regression, a supervised learning method used for binary and multi-class classification tasks. It demonstrates how to model the probability of a binary outcome and make predictions accordingly

### **Bagging**

 Bagging, short for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. This program explores how bagging can be used in analysing the performance of Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree Classifiers.

 ### **K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier**

 The K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm is a simple and effective classification technique. It demonstrates how to classify data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors

 ### **K-Fold Cross Validation Technique**

 Cross-validation is essential for assessing model performance. This program introduces K-fold cross-validation and uses it in combination with a decision tree classifier to evaluate and validate models effectively.

 ## 2. Unsupervised Learning
 Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data to uncover patterns or structures within the data.

 ### **Clustering Techniques**

 Delve into clustering methods such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models. These techniques group similar data points together, allowing you to uncover natural clusters within your data.

 ### **Principal Component Analysis**

 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features while preserving essential information. It helps in feature selection and data visualization.

 ## 3. Neural Networks

 Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

 ### **Perceptron**

 Explore the Perceptron algorithm, one of the foundational models in neural networks and machine learning. Understand its architecture and how it can be used for simple binary classification tasks

 ## 4. Reinforcement Learning

 Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions through trial and error interactions with an environment.

 ### **Q Learning**

Introduce yourself to reinforcement learning with Q-learning, a fundamental algorithm for training agents in environments. Learn how Q-learning is used for making sequential decisions

 ### **N-Queens**

 Solve the N-Queens problem using machine learning techniques, demonstrating its versatility in various domains. This program explores how machine learning can tackle complex problem-solving tasks.
